# Motivation

I chose to practice with Three.js because the concept of establishing 3d images and making them interactive is very cool. For the people who love to touch their computer screens to try to turn something one way. This framework fixes that. It is also going to be very useful for presentations and for leisure. Touchscreens have become an established trend, thus Three.js will allow a more interactive space. It could also potentially be used in the future to help practice surgeries, because now some surgeries are done by robots.

## Use
The alternative to using Three.js is to handwrite the javascript to make it responsive to click to move it around and keydowns to move the screen left and right (which was solved with orbitcontrols) while also adjusting using css and adding animations.



Three.js is maintained by http://three.js.org/
Here is also where you can download all the pre-made javascript files such as OrbitControls.js that will help you create the guidance controls with just one line of code.

Having built it, it does seem relatively easy to use and it is possible to create something with it, however each time something was wrong in the code, nothing would render and just a black screen would occur.

Conceptual hurdles would be that in order to create something individualized, you would have to create the object in a blender of some sort.

Three Interview Questions:
1) How would you like to use Three.js?
2) If you were given Three.js, what methods would you use to study it?
3) If you could build a game using Three.js, what would you build and why?
