# Motivation

I chose Three.js because the concept of establishing 3d images and making them interactive is very cool. For the people who love to touch their computer screens to try to turn something one way. This framework fixes that. It is also going to be very useful for presentations and for leisure. Touchscreens have become an established trend, thus three.js will allow a more interactive space.
